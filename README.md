# Visualisation of HRDIC data from an experiment on AZ31 Mg alloy

This repository contains a notebook and small module for data visualization of an experiment on AZ31 Mg alloy, which can be used as a companion to our article entitled " Why magnesium is not brittle: a quantitative study on the accommodation of deformation incompatibility".

Although it can be previewed using nbviewer, the best way to use is to clone it, run it using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), and download the data from Zenodo with the link provided.

The best way to get started with Jupyter notebook is to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). The default installation contains much more software than is needed but it works very well.
